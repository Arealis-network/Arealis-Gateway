## ðŸ“š Understanding Render

### What is Render?
Render is a cloud platform that automatically deploys your code from GitHub repositories. Think of it as a service that:
- Takes your code from GitHub
- Builds it (installs dependencies)
- Runs it on the internet
- Gives you a public URL

### Key Concepts:
- **Web Service**: Your application running on the internet
- **Build Command**: Instructions to prepare your code
- **Start Command**: Instructions to run your application
- **Environment Variables**: Secret settings (like database passwords)
- **Root Directory**: Which folder in your repository to use

### Render vs Other Platforms:
- **Easier than AWS**: No complex configuration
- **Similar to Heroku**: But with better free tier
- **Automatic deployments**: Updates when you push to GitHub

---

## ðŸš€ Deploying ACC Service (First Service)

### Why Start with ACC?
- Most complex service (has database connections)
- If this works, others will work too
- Sets up the foundation for other services

### Step 1: Create New Web Service
1. **Go to Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com
2. **Click "New +"** (top right corner)
3. **Select "Web Service"**

### Step 2: Connect Repository
1. **Click "Connect GitHub"**
2. **Find and select**: `swaroop-thakare/Magnus-Ai`
3. **Click "Connect"**
4. **Wait for repository to load**

### Step 3: Configure Basic Settings
Fill out the form with these **exact values**:

#### Basic Information:
- **Name**: `arealis-acc-service`
  - This will be your service URL: `https://arealis-acc-service.onrender.com`
- **Environment**: `Python 3`
- **Region**: `Oregon (US West)` (or closest to your users)
- **Branch**: `main`

#### Build & Deploy Settings:
- **Root Directory**: `services/acc`
  - This tells Render to look in the `services/acc` folder
- **Build Command**: `bash build.sh`
  - This runs our custom build script
- **Start Command**: `python simple_start.py`
  - This starts our application

#### Instance Settings:
- **Instance Type**: `Free`
  - Good for testing and development

### Step 4: Add Environment Variables
Environment variables are like secret settings that your app needs to work.

1. **Click "Advanced"** at the bottom of the form
2. **Click "Environment Variables"**
3. **Add these variables one by one** (click "Add Environment Variable" for each):

```
Name: DATABASE_URL
Value: postgresql://postgres:NmxNfLIKzWQzxwrmQUiKCouDXhcScjcD@switchyard.proxy.rlwy.net:25675/railway
```

```
Name: NEO4J_URI
Value: neo4j+s://6933b562.databases.neo4j.io
```

```
Name: NEO4J_USERNAME
Value: neo4j
```

```
Name: NEO4J_PASSWORD
Value: Yavi0NJTNDApnMb-InD3pCVwdgT7Hzd2-6vb-tYshZo
```

```
Name: NEO4J_DATABASE
Value: neo4j
```

```
Name: PORT
Value: 10000
```

### Step 5: Deploy Your Service
1. **Review all settings** to make sure they're correct
2. **Click "Create Web Service"** at the bottom
3. **Wait for deployment** (this takes 2-5 minutes)

### Step 6: Monitor Deployment
1. **Watch the build logs** in real-time
2. **Look for these success messages**:
   ```
   âœ… Building ACC service for Render...
   âœ… SQLAlchemy installed successfully
   âœ… FastAPI installed successfully
   âœ… Build completed successfully!
   âœ… Starting ACC Agent Service...
   âœ… Binding to host 0.0.0.0 on port 10000
   âœ… Service is live!
   ```

### Step 7: Test Your Service
Once deployment is complete:

1. **Go to your service URL**: `https://arealis-acc-service.onrender.com`
2. **Test health endpoint**: `https://arealis-acc-service.onrender.com/health`
3. **View API documentation**: `https://arealis-acc-service.onrender.com/docs`

---

## ðŸ”„ Deploying Remaining Services

Once ACC service is working, deploy the other 4 services using the same process:

### ARL Service
- **Name**: `arealis-arl-service`
- **Root Directory**: `services/arl`
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `python main_complete.py`
- **Environment Variables**: Only `PORT = 10001`

### CRRAK Service
- **Name**: `arealis-crrak-service`
- **Root Directory**: `services/crrak`
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `python main_simple.py`
- **Environment Variables**: Only `PORT = 10002`

### PDR Service
- **Name**: `arealis-pdr-service`
- **Root Directory**: `services/pdr`
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `python main.py`
- **Environment Variables**: Only `PORT = 10003`

### RCA Service
- **Name**: `arealis-rca-service`
- **Root Directory**: `services/rca`
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `python main_simple.py`
- **Environment Variables**: Only `PORT = 10004`

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your Deployments

### Health Check URLs
Test each service to make sure it's working:

- **ACC**: `https://arealis-acc-service.onrender.com/health`
- **ARL**: `https://arealis-arl-service.onrender.com/health`
- **CRRAK**: `https://arealis-crrak-service.onrender.com/health`
- **PDR**: `https://arealis-pdr-service.onrender.com/health`
- **RCA**: `https://arealis-rca-service.onrender.com/health`

### Expected Response
Each health check should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "service-name"
}
```

### API Documentation URLs
View the interactive API documentation:

- **ACC**: `https://arealis-acc-service.onrender.com/docs`
- **ARL**: `https://arealis-arl-service.onrender.com/docs`
- **CRRAK**: `https://arealis-crrak-service.onrender.com/docs`
- **PDR**: `https://arealis-pdr-service.onrender.com/docs`

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Build Fails
**Symptoms**: Build process stops with errors
**Solutions**:
1. Check build logs for specific error messages
2. Try changing build command to: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Make sure Root Directory is correct: `services/acc`

### Issue 2: Service Won't Start
**Symptoms**: Build succeeds but service crashes
**Solutions**:
1. Check start command is correct: `python simple_start.py`
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Try alternative start command: `gunicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`

### Issue 3: Database Connection Errors
**Symptoms**: Service starts but can't connect to database
**Solutions**:
1. Double-check environment variables (especially DATABASE_URL)
2. Make sure database credentials are correct
3. Check if database service is running

### Issue 4: Port Binding Errors
**Symptoms**: "Port binding" error messages
**Solutions**:
1. Ensure PORT environment variable is set to 10000
2. Make sure start command uses `0.0.0.0` as host
3. Try the gunicorn start command

### Issue 5: Module Not Found Errors
**Symptoms**: "ModuleNotFoundError" in logs
**Solutions**:
1. Check if build command installed all dependencies
2. Try using the enhanced build script: `bash build.sh`
3. Verify requirements.txt file exists

### Getting Help
1. **Check Render logs**: Go to your service â†’ "Logs" tab
2. **Check GitHub repository**: Make sure code is up to date
3. **Ask team members**: Someone else might have solved the same issue
4. **Render documentation**: https://render.com/docs
