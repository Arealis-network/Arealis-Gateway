# 👥 Team Deployment Coordination Guide

## 🎯 Deployment Strategy

### Recommended Approach:
1. **One person deploys first** (usually most experienced with Render)
2. **Document any issues** and solutions
3. **Share successful configuration** with team
4. **Others follow the same steps**
5. **Coordinate to avoid conflicts**

## 📋 Team Roles & Responsibilities

### Lead Deployer (First Person)
- ✅ Deploy ACC service first (most complex)
- ✅ Test all endpoints and functionality
- ✅ Document any issues and solutions
- ✅ Share working configuration with team
- ✅ Help troubleshoot other team members' issues

### Team Members
- ✅ Follow the detailed deployment guide
- ✅ Use the configuration shared by lead deployer
- ✅ Test their deployments thoroughly
- ✅ Report any new issues to the team
- ✅ Help each other troubleshoot

### Project Manager
- ✅ Coordinate deployment schedule
- ✅ Track deployment progress
- ✅ Ensure all services are deployed
- ✅ Monitor for any blocking issues

## 🗓️ Suggested Deployment Schedule

### Day 1: Setup & ACC Service
- **Morning**: Lead deployer sets up Render account and deploys ACC service
- **Afternoon**: Lead deployer tests ACC service thoroughly
- **Evening**: Lead deployer shares configuration and results with team

### Day 2: Remaining Services
- **Morning**: Team members deploy ARL, CRRAK, PDR, RCA services
- **Afternoon**: Testing and troubleshooting
- **Evening**: Final verification and documentation

### Day 3: Integration & Testing
- **Morning**: End-to-end testing of all services
- **Afternoon**: Performance testing and optimization
- **Evening**: Documentation and handover

## 🔄 Communication Protocol

### Daily Standup Questions:
1. **What did you deploy yesterday?**
2. **What issues did you encounter?**
3. **What are you deploying today?**
4. **Do you need help with anything?**

### Issue Reporting:
When you encounter an issue:
1. **Check troubleshooting guide** first
2. **Try suggested solutions**
3. **If still stuck, report to team** with:
   - Service name
   - Exact error message
   - Steps you've already tried
   - Screenshots if helpful

### Success Sharing:
When you successfully deploy:
1. **Share the working configuration**
2. **Document any custom steps** you took
3. **Update the team tracking table**
4. **Help others with the same service**

## 🚨 Common Issues & Team Solutions

### Issue: Multiple people trying to deploy same service
**Solution**: Coordinate service assignments
- Person A: ACC + ARL
- Person B: CRRAK + PDR  
- Person C: RCA + Testing

### Issue: Environment variable conflicts
**Solution**: Use consistent naming
- All services use `PORT = 10000` (Render will handle port assignment)
- Database variables only for ACC service
- Other services only need PORT variable

### Issue: Repository access problems
**Solution**: Ensure everyone has access
- Verify GitHub repository permissions
- Make sure repository is public or team has access
- Use consistent repository: `swaroop-thakare/Magnus-Ai`

### Issue: Service name conflicts
**Solution**: Use consistent naming convention
- `arealis-{service}-service`
- Example: `arealis-acc-service`, `arealis-arl-service`
